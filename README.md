# The Interview Project

Technical interviews tend to be hand-wavy exercises focused on toy applications or over emphasize on lofty concepts and techniques. This project provides realistic scenarios for assessing a candidate's fundamental engineering skills: remote/asynchronous collaboration, code review, version control, and testing, to name a few.

Refer to the [contribution guide](/CONTRIBUTING.md) to get started.

## Architecture

Currently, the project consists of a Go microservice and a corresponding client application. They communicate using [gRPC](https://grpc.io/).

```
-------------------            -------------------
| Client          |            | Server          |
| --------        |            |                 |
| | SDK* |        | <--gRPC--> |                 |

| Containerization       | Caution: Local Docker setup can be tricky so this should be a nice-to-have, not a requirement to contribute. |
